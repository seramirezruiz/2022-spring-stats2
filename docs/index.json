The practical component of the Statistics II: Statistical Modeling and Causal Inference course relies largely in R programming. Today we will center on some of the necessary skills to perform the assignments for the course.\nIn this tutorial, you will learn to:\n identify the some of the basic functionalities of R and RStudio import data sets into your R environment  R and RStudio: Basics The RStudio layout RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Think of RStudio as a front that allows us to interact, compile, and render R code in a more instinctive way. The following image shows what the standard RStudio interface looks like:\n    Console: The console provides a means to interact directly with R. You can type some code at the console and when you press ENTER, R will run that code. Depending on what you type, you may see some output in the console or if you make a mistake, you may get a warning or an error message.\n  Script editor: You will utilize the script editor to complete your assignments. The script editor will be the space where files will be displayed. For example, once you download and open the bi-weekly assignment .Rmd template, it will appear here. The editor is a where you should place code you care about, since the code from the console cannot be saved into a script.\n  Environment: This area holds the abstractions you have created with your code. If you run myresult \u0026lt;- 5+3+2, the myresult object will appear there.\n  Plots and files: This area will be where graphic output will be generated. Additionally, if you write a question mark before any function, (i.e. ?mean) the online documentation will be displayed here.\n   R Packages For the most part, R Packages are collections of code and functions that leverage R programming to expand on the basic functionalities. Last week we met dplyr that aids R programmers in the process of data cleaning and manipulation. There are a plethora of packages in R designed to facilite the completion of tasks. In fact, this website is built with the blogdown package that lets you create websites using RMarkdown and Hugo\nUnlike other programming languages, in R you only need to install a package once. The following times you will only need to \u0026ldquo;require\u0026rdquo; the package. As a good practice I recommend running the code to install packages only in your R console, not in the code editor. You can install a package with the following syntax\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;name_of_your_package\u0026quot;) #note that the quotation marks are mandatory at this stage  Once the package has been installed, you just need to \u0026ldquo;call it\u0026rdquo; every time you want to use it in a file by running:\nlibrary(\u0026quot;name_of_your_package\u0026quot;) #either of this lines will require the package library(name_of_your_package) #library understands the code with, or without, quotation marks   It is extremely important that you do not have any lines installing packages for your assignments because the file will fail to knit    Working directory The working directory is just a file path on your computer that sets the default location of any files you read into R, or save out of R. Normally, when you open RStudio it will have a default directory (a folder in your computer). You can check you directory by running getwd() in your console:\n#this is the default in my case getwd() #[1] \u0026quot;/Users/sebastianramirezruiz\u0026quot;  When your RStudio is closed and you open a file from your finder in MacOS or file explorer in Windows, the default working directory will be the folder where the file is hosted\n Setting your working directory You can set you directory manually from RStudio: use the menu to change your working directory under Session \u0026gt; Set Working Directory \u0026gt; Choose Directory.\n  You can also use the setwd() function:\nsetwd(\u0026quot;/path/to/your/directory\u0026quot;) #in macOS setwd(\u0026quot;c:/path/to/your/directory\u0026quot;) #in windows   Recommended folder structure for the class   We recommend you pay close attention to your folder structure. You will receive a new folder for each assignment. Make the folder your working directory when working on the assignment. This folder will be populated with the template .Rmd and the data for the week. When you knit the file, the .html will be created in this folder.\n We will learn more about the assignment submission workflow next week. Still, avoid changing the name of the files you receive in Github since it will create issues.    Dealing with errors in R Errors in R occur when code is used in a way that it is not intended. For example when you try to add two character strings, you will get the following error:\n\u0026quot;hello\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;world\u0026quot; Error in \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;world\u0026quot;: non-numeric argument to binary operator  Normally, when something has gone wrong with your program, R will notify you of an error in the console. There are errors that will prevent the code from running, while others will only produce warning messages. In the following case, the code will run, but you will notice that the string \u0026ldquo;three\u0026rdquo; is turned into a NA.\nas.numeric(c(\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;three\u0026quot;)) Warning: NAs introduced by coercion [1] 1 2 NA  Since we will be utilizing widely used packages and functions in the course of the semester, the errors that you may come across in the process of completing your assignments will be common for other R users. Most errors occur because of typos. A Google search of the error message can take you a long way as well. Most of the times the first entry on stackoverflow.com will solve the problem.\n Importing data Next we will work with data provided by the palmerpenguins package; however, most practical applications will require you to work with your own data. In fact, for most assignments, you will be given a data set to work with. As we will see in the coming weeks, data are messy. You know what else is messy? Data formats. You may be acquainted with a couple of them (.csv, .tsv, .xlsx).\nFortunately for us, the tidyverse has two packages that make the process of loading data sets from different formats very easy.\n readr: The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, rds, and fwf) haven: The goal of haven is to enable R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical packages (like dta, sas, and sav)  You can read more about how to load different types of data in the respective documentations of the packages — readr and haven\n For the assignments you will be required to load datasets. You can do that by installing the readr package and utilizing:\n#with readr your_data_frame \u0026lt;- readr::read_rds(\u0026quot;path_for_the_file\u0026quot;) #you can alternatively use a base R option your_data_frame \u0026lt;- base::readRDS(\u0026quot;path_for_the_file\u0026quot;)  This week\u0026rsquo;s mock assignment will feature a .tsv file. When in doubt just Google \u0026ldquo;How to load x_format data in R?\u0026quot; That will do the trick!\n The double colon operator :: You may have noted in the previous section that the functions were preceded by their package name and two colons, for example: readr::read_rds(). The double colon operator :: helps us ensure that we select functions from a particular package. We utilize the operator to explicitly state where the function is coming. This may become even more important when you are doing data analysis as part of a team further in your careers. Though it is likely that this will not be a problem during the course, we can try to employ the following convention package_name::function() to ensure that we will not encounter errors in our knitting process:\ndplyr::select()   Let\u0026rsquo;s look at what happens when we load tidyverse.\nlibrary(tidyverse) #── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 #── #✓ ggplot2 3.3.2 ✓ purrr 0.3.4 #✓ tibble 3.0.3 ✓ dplyr 1.0.2 #✓ tidyr 1.1.2 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 #✓ readr 1.3.1 ✓ forcats 0.5.0 #── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() #── #x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() #x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag()  You may notice that R points out some conflicts where some functions are being masked. The default in this machine will become the filter() from the dplyr package during this session. If you were to run some code that is based on the filter() from the stats package, your code will probably result in errors.\n ","date":1612310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612310400,"objectID":"027efd9630c3bd9e00a3f8413c01c502","permalink":"https://seramirezruiz.github.io/2022-spring-stats2/materials/session-1/foundations/","publishdate":"2021-02-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2022-spring-stats2/materials/session-1/foundations/","section":"materials","summary":"Welcome!

Introduction Welcome! Welcome to our second tutorial for the Statistics II: Statistical Modeling \u0026amp; Causal Inference (with R) course.\nThe labs are designed to reinforce the material covered during the lectures by introducing you to hands-on applications.\nThe practical nature of our class means that our labs will be data-centered. Throughout our class, we will get acquinted with multiple packages of the tidyverse.\nThough we expect that some of you may already know them, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share an underlying design, syntax, and structure. They will definitely make your life easier!!\nToday, we will start with a brief introduction to data manipulation through the dplyr package.\nIn this tutorial, you will learn to:\n identify the purpose of a set of dplyr verbs write statements in tidy syntax apply dplyr verbs to solve your data manipulation challenges  This tutorial is partly based on R for Data Science, section 5.2, and Quantitative Politics with R, chapter 3.\n What we will need today We’ll practice some wrangling in dplyr using data for penguin sizes recorded by Dr. Kristen Gorman and others at several islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Data are originally published in: Gorman KB, Williams TD, Fraser WR (2014) PLoS ONE 9(3): e90081. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090081\nYou do not need to import the data to work through this tutorial - the data are already here waiting behind the scenes.\nBut if you do ever want to use the penguins data outside of this tutorial, they now exist in the palmerpenguins package in R.\nLet’s begin!\n 2. Data Structure Tidy data Generally, we will encounter data in a tidy format. Tidy data refers to a way of mapping the structure of a data set. In a tidy data set:\n Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table  The penguins data set The 3 species of penguins in this data set are Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. The data set contains 8 variables:\n species: a factor denoting the penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo) island: a factor denoting the island (in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica) where observed culmen_length_mm: a number denoting length of the dorsal ridge of penguin bill (millimeters) culmen_depth_mm: a number denoting the depth of the penguin bill (millimeters) flipper_length_mm: an integer denoting penguin flipper length (millimeters) body_mass_g: an integer denoting penguin body mass (grams) sex: a factor denoting penguin sex (MALE, FEMALE) year an integer denoting the year of the record  *Illustration by @allisonhorst* Let’s explore the data set. head() is a function that returns the first couple rows from a data frame. Write the R code required to explore the first observations of the penguins data set:\nNotice that when you press ‘Run,’ the output of the code is returned below it! So by pressing ‘Run,’ you’ve run your first R code of the class!\nhead(penguins)    species  island  bill\\_length\\_mm  bill\\_depth\\_mm  flipper\\_length\\_mm  body\\_mass\\_g  sex  year      Adelie  Torgersen  39.1  18.7  181  3750  male  2007    Adelie  Torgersen  39.5  17.4  186  3800  female  2007    Adelie  Torgersen  40.3  18.0  195  3250  female  2007    Adelie  Torgersen  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  2007    Adelie  Torgersen  36.7  19.3  193  3450  female  2007    Adelie  Torgersen  39.3  20.6  190  3650  male  2007      3. Manipulating data with dplyr What we will learn today In this tutorial, you’ll learn and practice examples using some functions in dplyr to work with data. Those are:\n select(): keep or exclude some columns filter(): keep rows that satisfy your conditions mutate(): add columns from existing data or edit existing columns group_by(): lets you define groups within your data set summarize(): get summary statistics arrange(): reorders the rows according to single or multiple variables  Let’s get to work.\n 3.1. select() The first verb (function) we will utilize is select(). We can employ it to manipulate our data based on columns. If you recall from our initial exploration of the data set there were eight variables attached to every observation. Do you recall them? If you do not, there is no problem. You can utilize names() to retrieve the names of the variables in a data frame.\nnames(penguins)  ## [1] \u0026quot;species\u0026quot; \u0026quot;island\u0026quot; \u0026quot;bill_length_mm\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;bill_depth_mm\u0026quot; \u0026quot;flipper_length_mm\u0026quot; \u0026quot;body_mass_g\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;sex\u0026quot; \u0026quot;year\u0026quot;  Say we are only interested in the species, island, and year variables of these data, we can utilize the following syntax:\n select(data, columns)   Activity The following code chunk would select the species, island, and year variables. What should we do to keep the body_mass_g and sex variables as well?\ndplyr::select(penguins, species, island, year)   Answer # you just need to type the names of the columns dplyr::select(penguins, species, island, year, body_mass_g, sex)     To drop variables, use - before the variable name.\nFor example, select(penguins, -year) will drop the year column.\n   3.2. filter() The second verb (function) we will employ is filter(). filter() lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. To use filter(), pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. filter() will return every row that passes each logical test.\nThe more commonly used logical operators are:\n ==: Equal to !=: Not equal to \u0026gt;, \u0026gt;=: Greater than, greater than or equal to \u0026lt;, \u0026lt;=: Less than, less than or equal to \u0026amp;, |: And, or  Say we are interested in retrieving the observations from the year 2007. We would do:\ndplyr::filter(penguins, year == 2007)   Activity Can you adapt the code to retrieve all the observations of Chinstrap penguins from 2007 (remember that species contains character units)\nAnswer # you just need to utilize \u0026amp; and type the logical operator for the species dplyr::filter(penguins, year == 2007 \u0026amp; species == \u0026quot;Chinstrap\u0026quot;)     3.3. The Pipe Operator: %\u0026gt;% The pipe, %\u0026gt;%, comes from the magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache. Packages in the tidyverse load %\u0026gt;% for you automatically, so you don’t usually load magrittr explicitly. This will be one of your best friends in R. \u0026gt;Pipes are a powerful tool for clearly expressing a sequence of multiple operations. Let’s think about baking for a second.\n Activity We can leverage the pipe operator to sequence our code in a logical manner. Can you adapt the following code chunk with the pipe and conditional logical operators we discussed?\nonly_2009 \u0026lt;- dplyr::filter(penguins, year == 2009) only_2009_chinstraps \u0026lt;- dplyr::filter(only_2009, species == \u0026quot;Chinstrap\u0026quot;) only_2009_chinstraps_species_sex_year \u0026lt;- dplyr::select(only_2009_chinstraps, species, sex, year) final_df \u0026lt;- only_2009_chinstraps_species_sex_year final_df #to print it in our console  Answer penguins %\u0026gt;% #we start off with out df dplyr::filter(year == 2009 \u0026amp; species == \u0026quot;Chinstrap\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% #filter dplyr::select(species, sex, year) #select     3.4. mutate() mutate() lets us create, modify, and delete columns. The most common use for now will be to create new variables based on existing ones. Say we are working with a U.S. American client and they feel more confortable with assessing the weight of the penguins in pounds. We would utilize mutate() as such:\n  mutate(new\\_var\\_name = conditions)  Activity Can you edit the following code chunk to render a new variable body_mass_kg?\npenguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(body_mass_lbs = body_mass_g/453.6)   Answer penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) #grams divided by 1000     3.5. group_by() and summarize() These two verbs group_by() and summarize() tend to go together. When combined , ’summarize()` will create a new data frame. It will have one (or more) rows for each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables, the output will have a single row summarising all observations in the input. For example:\n summarize():  penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::summarize(heaviest_penguin = max(body_mass_g, na.rm = T)) #max() does not know how to deal with NAs very well    heaviest\\_penguin      6300      group_by() + summarize():  penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(species) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::summarize(heaviest_penguin = max(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))    species  heaviest\\_penguin      Adelie  4775    Chinstrap  4800    Gentoo  6300     Activity Can you get the weight of the lightest penguin of each species? You can use min(). What happens when in addition to species you also group by year group_by(species, year)?\nAnswers penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(species) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::summarize(lightest_penguin = min(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))    species  lightest\\_penguin      Adelie  2850    Chinstrap  2700    Gentoo  3950     penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(species, year) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::summarize(lightest_penguin = max(body_mass_g, na.rm = T))  ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'species'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.    3.6. arrange() The arrange() verb is pretty self-explanatory. arrange() orders the rows of a data frame by the values of selected columns in ascending order. You can use the desc() argument inside to arrange in descending order. The following chunk arranges the data frame based on the length of the penguins’ bill. You hint tab contains the code for the descending order alternative.\n arrange(variable\\_of\\_interest)  penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::arrange(bill_length_mm)   penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::arrange(desc(bill_length_mm))   Activity Can you create a data frame arranged by body_mass_g of the penguins observed in the “Dream” island?\nAnswer penguins %\u0026gt;% dplyr::filter(island == \u0026quot;Dream\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::arrange(desc(body_mass_g))    ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0e5dbbf98949e49081cad709093af1a5","permalink":"https://seramirezruiz.github.io/2022-spring-stats2/materials/session-2/data-manipulation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2022-spring-stats2/materials/session-2/data-manipulation/","section":"materials","summary":"1.

The data frame contains the following four variables:\n student_id: numeric student identification prej_0: prejudice level under \\(Y_{0i}\\) (Contact=0) prej_1: prejudice level under \\(Y_{1i}\\) (Contact=1) dorm_type: binary for actual treatment state  ## # A tibble: 8 x 4 ## student_id prej_0 prej_1 dorm_type ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 6 5 0 ## 2 2 4 2 1 ## 3 3 4 4 0 ## 4 4 6 7 0 ## 5 5 3 1 1 ## 6 6 2 2 1 ## 7 7 8 7 0 ## 8 8 4 5 0   Treatment Effects a) Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) We assume from the potential outcomes framework that each subject has a potential outcome under both treatment states. Let's take the first student in the list as an example.\nThe figure illustrates the potential outcomes for Student 1.\nWe see that in a reality where Student 1 is assigned to in-group dorm (contact=0) their levels of prejudice are 6. On the contrary, in a reality where Student 1 is assigned to co-ethnic dorm (contact=1) their levels of prejudice are 5.\nFrom this illustration, we can gather the individual treatment effect (ITE) for student one. The ITE is equal to the values under treatment (contact=1) minus to the values without treatment (contact=0) or \\(ITE = y_{1i} - y_{0i}\\).\n\\[ITE = 5 - 6 = -1\\]\n As it was put in Cunningham\u0026rsquo;s book:\nThe ITE is a “comparison of two states of the world” (Cunningham, 2021): individuals are exposed to contact, and not exposed to it.\n  Evidently, each subject can only be observed in one treatment state at any point in time in real life. This is known as the fundamental problem (Holland, 1986) of causal inference. The Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) in reality is unattainable. Still, it provides us with a conceptual foundation for causal estimation.\nExercise: Our data are coming from a world with perfect information. In that sense, we have both potential outcomes prej_0 and prej_1. Can you think of a way to calculate the ITE for the eight students with one of the dplyr verbs we learned in the previous section?\nHint Can you think of a way we can use the verb mutate()\n Answer #you can employ dplyr::mutate() to create the new variable ite prejudice_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(ite = prej_1 - prej_0)   student_id  prej_0  prej_1  dorm_type  ite      1  6  5  0  -1    2  4  2  1  -2    3  4  4  0  0    4  6  7  0  1    5  3  1  1  -2    6  2  2  1  0    7  8  7  0  -1    8  4  5  0  1       Average Treatment Effect (ATE) Normally, we are not interested in the estimates of individual subjects, but rather a population. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is the difference in the average potential outcomes of the population.\n\\[ATE = E(Y_{1i}) - E(Y_{0i})\\]\nIn other words, the ATE is the average ITE of all the subjects in the population. As you can see, the ATE as defined in the formula is also not attainable. Can you think why?\nExercise: Since our data are coming from a world with perfect information. Can you think of a way to calculate the ATE for the eight students based on what we learned last week?\nHint We have already extracted the ite with mutate(). We know that the the ATE is the averge of every subject's ITE. Do you remember summarize()?\n Answer #we know that the ATE is the averge of every subject\u0026#39;s ITE. Do you remember dplyr::summarize()? #how can we use the verbs from last week to get the average treatment effect? prejudice_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(ite = prej_1 - prej_0) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::summarize(ate=mean(ite))   ate      -0.5       The Average Treatment Effect Among the Treated and Control (ATT) and (ATC) The names for these two estimates are very self-explanatory. These two estimates are simply the average treatment effects conditional on the group subjects are assigned to.\nThe average treatment effect on the treated ATT is defined as the difference in the average potential outcomes for those subjects who were treated: \\[ATT = E(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i} | D = 1)\\]\nThe average treatment effect under control ATC is defined as the difference in the average potential outcomes for those subjects who were not treated: \\[ATC = E(Y_{1i}-Y_{0i} | D = 0)\\]\nExercise: Since our data are coming from a world with perfect information. Can you think of a way to calculate the ATT and ATC for the eight students based on what we learned last week?\nHint We have already extracted the ite with mutate(). We know that the ATT and ATC are the average of every subject's ITE grouped by their treatment status. Do you remember how the combination of group_by() and summarize() worked?\n Answer #we know that the ATT and ATC are the average of every subject\u0026#39;s ITE grouped by their treatment status. Do you remember how the combination of dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::summarize() worked? #how can we use the verbs from last week to get the average treatment effect on the treated and untreated? prejudice_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(ite = prej_1 - prej_0) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(dorm_type) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::summarize(treatment_effects=mean(ite))   dorm_type  treatment_effects      0  0.000000    1  -1.333333       The Naive Average Treatment Effect (NATE) So far, we have worked with perfect information. Still, we know that in reality we can only observe subjects in one treatment state. This is the information we do have.\n The Naive Average Treatment Effect (NATE) is the calculation we can compute based on the observed outcomes.   \\[NATE = E(Y_{1i}|D{i}=1) - E(Y_{0i}|D{i}=0)\\] *reads in English as: \u0026quot;The expected average outcome under treatment for those treated minus the expected average outcome under control for those not treated\u0026quot;\nExercise: Can you think of a way to calculate the NATE for the eight students employing the new observed_prej variable?\nprejudice_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(observed_prej = ifelse(dorm_type == 1, prej_1, prej_0))   student_id  prej_0  prej_1  dorm_type  observed_prej      1  6  5  0  6    2  4  2  1  2    3  4  4  0  4    4  6  7  0  6    5  3  1  1  1    6  2  2  1  2    7  8  7  0  8    8  4  5  0  4     Hint We have already extracted the average observed outcomes depending on the treatment status with mutate(). We know that the NATE is the difference in average observed outcomes grouped by their treatment status. Do you remember how the combination of group_by() and summarize() worked?\n Answer #we know that the NATE is the difference in average observed outcomes grouped by their treatment status. Do you remember how the combination of dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::summarize() worked? prejudice_df %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(observed_prej = ifelse(dorm_type == 1, prej_1, prej_0)) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::group_by(dorm_type) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::summarize(mean(observed_prej)) #You can just substract the values   dorm_type  mean(observed_prej)      0  5.600000    1  1.666667     You can just substract the values\n Note. The ìfelse() function is a very handy tool to have. It allows us to generate conditional statements. The syntax is the following:\nifelse(condition_to_meet, what_to_do_if_met, what_to_do_if_not_met) In the case of observed_prej, we ask R to create a new variable, where if the subject is in a co-ethnic dorm, we print the prejudice value under treatment. If that condition is not met, we print the prejudice value under control.\n  Bias Bias During the lecture, we met two sources of bias:\n Baseline bias Baseline bias—also known as selection bias— is difference in expected outcomes in the absence of treatment for the actual treatment and control group. In other words, these are the underlying differences that individuals in either group start off with.\n Differential treatment effect bias Differential treatment effect bias — also known as Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) bias — is the difference in returns to treatment (the treatment effect) between the treatment and control group, multiplied by the share of the population in control. In other words, this type of bias relates to the dissimilarities stemming for ways in which individuals in either group are affected differently by the treatment.\nWe will let you think about these for the mock assignment\nExercise: Since our data are coming from a world with perfect information. Can you think of a way to explore the existence baseline bias in our data?\nHint We know that the baseline bias is the difference in average observed outcomes under control grouped by their treatment status. Do you remember how the combination of dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::summarize() worked?\n Exercise: Since our data are coming from a world with perfect information. Can you think of a way to explore the existence differential treatment effect bias in our data?\nHint We know that the differential treatment effect bias is the difference in difference in the average of every subject's ITE grouped by their treatment status (or the difference between ATT and ATCs). Maybe you can go back an check how to get the average treatment effect on the treated and untreated.\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"78779ae7cd8fe70a383794e67e25c038","permalink":"https://seramirezruiz.github.io/2022-spring-stats2/materials/session-2/pof/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2022-spring-stats2/materials/session-2/pof/","section":"materials","summary":"The POF in practice Let's revisit the example from our slides once again.\nSay we are interested in assessing the premise of Allport's hypothesis about interpersonal contact being conducive to reducing intergroup prejudice.","tags":null,"title":"The Potential Outcomes Framework","type":"book"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
